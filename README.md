# Flask-Grafana-API-Integration
This Flask application integrates with Grafana's API to manage alert rules and fetch dashboard data. It provides endpoints to create alerts, retrieve alert rules, and fetch dashboard information. With simple JSON payloads, users can create and manage Grafana alerts directly from their Flask environment.
